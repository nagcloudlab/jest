why do we need javascript?

- to build web-ui apps  ( react, angular )
- to build mobile native apps ( react-native, ionic )
- to build server side apps ( node.js + express , nest.js )
- to build desktop apps ( electron )
- to build command line tools ( node.js + yargs  )

What is Unit Testing?

    - Testing a small piece of code ( function, class, module )


The key aspects of unit testing include:

- Isolation: The unit test should only test the functionality of the unit of code it is targeting. It should not depend on any external resources such as a database, network, or file system. This is to ensure that the test is repeatable and independent of any external factors.
- Automation: Unit tests should be automated and repeatable. This means that they can be run at any time and as many times as needed without human intervention.
- Documentation: Unit tests should serve as documentation for the code they are testing. They should describe the expected behavior of the code and provide examples of how it should be used.

Importance of Unit Testing in Software Development

    - It helps to identify bugs early in the development process.
    - It helps to ensure that the code is working as expected.
    - It helps to improve the quality of the code.
    - It helps to reduce the time and effort required for manual testing.
    - It helps to reduce the cost of fixing bugs in production.

Benefits and Challenges of Unit Testing

Benefits

- Improved code quality: Unit testing helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which leads to improved code quality.
- Faster development: Unit testing helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which leads to faster development.
- Reduced cost: Unit testing helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which leads to reduced cost.
- Increased confidence: Unit testing helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which leads to increased confidence in the code.

Challenges

- Time-consuming: Writing unit tests can be time-consuming, especially for complex code.
- Maintenance: Unit tests need to be maintained as the code changes, which can be challenging.
- Overhead: Writing and maintaining unit tests adds overhead to the development process.
